 ## Description
 The purpose of this project was to build an application that could organize and store employee information using a content management system (CMS). The user can use the terminal to view, add, update, and delete employee information. The motivation behind this project was to gain greater familiarity with databases such as MySql, server environments such as node.js, and NPM packages such as inquirer. This project has taught me how to create and access databases to store user information.
